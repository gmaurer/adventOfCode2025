# Advent of Code 2025

A Go implementation of Advent of Code 2025 solutions.

## Description

This repository contains solutions to the Advent of Code 2025 programming puzzles, implemented in Go. Each day's challenge is solved independently, with focus on completing the first part of each puzzle. This may not be the most efficent, as the goal is to practice and improve Golang so I want to explore Go functionality over low LOC clever solutions.
